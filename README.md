1)   Let   h [n] be   an   ideal   low   pass   filter   given   by

(a)    Compute   its   frequency   response   function   H   (ejω). 
(b)    Calculate   |H   (ejω0)| and ∠H   (ejω0)   for ω0 = 63.6. 
(c)    Design a window with a   length   of 20 sampling   times   (containing   21 samples)   for   h   [n]   and   choose   N      that   would   guarantee   a   linear   phase   response.   Write   the   frequency   response   of the   filter. 
2)   A   finite-length   complex   exponential   signal   is   given   by   x   [n]   =   ejωn,   n ∈   [0,   N   − 1].   The DFT   of x   [n]   satisfies 

By   using   the   approximation   sin   θ   ≈   θ, |θ| < 0.2 rad, show that |X [k]| is approximately bounded by  for   a   suitable   range   of   k.   Give   the   range  代 写Digital Signal Processing and Digital Filters Practice Sheet 4R
代做程序编程语言 for   k   for   which   the   bound   applies   and   explain   the   significance   of the   term  
3)   Given   a   maximum   transition   width   of ∆ω   = 0.2 rad/s,   compute   the   stop   band   gain   for   a   filter   with   a   number   of M   = 50   taps.
4)   Let  denote   the   number   of   taps   of   a   low   pass   filter, and   let   ∆ω1 =   2∆ω0   .
(a)    Give general expressions of M1 and ϵ1 as function of M0,   ϵ0 and   ∆ω0 that correspond   to   the   number   of   taps   and   stop   band   gain   corresponding   to   a   filter   with   transition   bandwidth   ∆ω1 = 2∆ω0   . 
(b)      What   can   be   said   about   the   change   in   number   of   taps   and   stop   band   gain?   What   are   the   conditions   to   guarantee   this   change?
